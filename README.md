# isam_genMonteCarlo

This project is to add several instances of noise to isam-style datasets, to generate Monte Carlo simulations. 

It uses python3, and its progressbar. To install in debian based linux distros: 

sudo apt-get install python3 python3-progressbar

it also uses isam, it assumes that the isam binary is somewhere in the search path.
